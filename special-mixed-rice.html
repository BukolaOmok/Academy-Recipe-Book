            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Prepare the Rice</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse the rice until the water runs clear to remove excess starch. This helps the rice not to stick.</li>
                <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt, some onion and the rice. Cook according to package instructions until just tender. Drain any excess water and set aside.</li>
              </ol>   

              <h3>Prepare the Protein</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Add the lamb pieces and sauté until they start to brown.</li>
                <li>Add prawns, squid, and mussels. Cook until the prawns are pink and the mussels have opened (discard any that do not open).</li>
                <li>Remove the seafood and lamb from the skillet and set aside.</li>
              </ol>
              
              <h3>Saute the Vegetables</h3>
              <ol>
                  <li>In the same skillet, add more oil if needed. Sauté onions, bell peppers, tomatoes, garlic, and ginger until the onions are translucent and the tomatoes break down into a sauce.</li>
                  <li>Stir in your selected spices and cook for an additional minute to release their flavors.</li>
                </ol> 

                <h3>Combine and Finish Cooking:</h3>
              <ol>
                    <li>Return the cooked lamb and seafood to the skillet with the vegetables.</li>
                    <li>Add the cooked rice, gently folding it in to mix thoroughly with the vegetable and protein mixture.</li>
                    <li>Reduce heat to low. Cover and let simmer for 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the sauce to be absorbed by the rice.</li>
                </ol>
