            <li>3 cups long grain <strong>rice</strong> (Basmati or Jasmin rice work great!)</li>
            <li>4 cups hot <strong>water</strong> when cooking rice</li>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        
        <p><strong>1.</strong> Trim beef of excess fat and sinews (aka the chewy stuff), pat the meat dry with a paper towel and chop into 1/2″ to 3/4″ pieces.</p>
        <p><strong>2.</strong>  Preheat your dutch oven (or your large soup pot with a heavy bottom), to high heat. Once it is hot, stir in your 1/3 cup canola oil. Once oil is hot, add chopped meat and saute uncovered 7 min over high heat until meat is browned, stirring every minute or so so it doesn not scorch to the bottom of the pan.</p> 
            <p> <i>Note: it is important to preheat the dutch oven first for the meat to sear over very high heat, otherwise it will juice out and become dry. </i> </p> 
        <p><strong>3.</strong>  Reduce heat to medium and Add chopped onion, stirring often until onion is softened (5 minutes). Stir in sliced carrots, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp cumin, 3-4 bay leaves and continue to cook over medium heat 5 minutes until carrots are softened.</p>
        <p><strong>4.</strong> Add 1 3/4 cups hot water, cover & simmer over medium/low heat 45 min or until meat is tender.</p>
        <p><strong>5.</strong> Meanwhile, rinse rice until water runs clear, then drain and set aside (this gets rid of the starch so you will not end up with a sticky rice). Did I ever tell you I love my OXO strainer? This thing is so versatile (from sifting flour, rinsing and draining, to wearing it as a helmet and chasing your toddler around the house?</p>
        <p><strong>6.</strong> Spread rice over the meat and add 4 cups hot water. Sprinkle the rice with 1 1/2 tsp salt (DO NOT STIR), bring to a boil then reduce heat to low and Let cook <strong>uncovered</strong> until most of the water is absorbed (10 min).</p>
        <p><strong>7.</strong> Cut off the base of your whole garlic head to expose the cloves. Put your head of garlic, cut side down into the center of the rice and sprinkle the top of the rice with 1 tsp ground coriander.</p>
        <p><strong>8.</strong>  Poke 7-10 holes through the rice to allow steam to escape to the surface, <u>reduce the heat to low</u>, then cover and cook an additional 15 minutes or until rice is cooked through. Remove the garlic head and bay leaves and stir everything gently to combine and you are done.</p>
